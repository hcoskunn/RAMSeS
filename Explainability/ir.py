"""
Intermediate Representation (IR) for the LLM interface layer.

Structures every explainability layer's output into standardized, grounded JSON
so a language model can render natural-language explanations WITHOUT computing,
ranking, or inferring anything itself. Each fact is an *atom*:

    {"id", "type", "subject", "value", "text", "confidence"?}

where `text` is a canonical sentence rendered here, in code, with numbers
already rounded — the LLM's job is compression and fluency over given
sentences. Atom ids make the thesis's faithfulness verifier mechanical
(hallucination = generated claims matching no atom; omission = required atoms
not stated → `required_atom_ids`).

Anti-hallucination principles implemented here:
  * judgments are computed in code and shipped as closed enums, never derived
    by the LLM;
  * no arrays, matrices, trajectories, or ASCII rule dumps — only scalars,
    top-k lists (k recorded), pre-computed comparatives, and structured rules
    extracted from fitted trees;
  * confidence is data: held-out fidelity, support counts, and degenerate
    flags become fields + caveat atoms (a caveat atom is a pre-written
    limitation sentence the LLM may restate);
  * deterministic bytes: sorted keys, fixed rounding, `ir_version`, no
    timestamps → identical inputs give identical JSON;
  * nothing implicit: missing/undefined → the explicit string "not_available".

This module is numpy + stdlib only. Tree rules are extracted by introspecting
a fitted DecisionTreeClassifier's `tree_` arrays, so sklearn is never imported
here.

    Thompson Sampling ranks detectors by ||mu_k||^2, but build_thompson_ir
    explains mu^T x — the expected reward that drove per-window selection. This
    builder explains the ranking itself: ||mu||^2 splits exactly into one
    non-negative contribution per context feature, and the winner's margin over the
    runner-up splits exactly into one signed term per context feature.

    `winner_context_features` is [(context feature, contribution)] for the winner, descending;
    `gap_context_features` is [(context feature, signed delta)] for winner-minus-runner-up,
    sorted by descending magnitude. Both are precomputed by
    explain_thompson_ranking, which owns the decomposition helpers.
