"""
LLM narration layer: renders the Intermediate Representation (IR) JSONs into
natural-language explanations with a LOCAL open-weights model, and scores every
narrative with the atom-matching faithfulness verifier.

The client speaks the OpenAI-compatible chat API (default: Ollama at
http://localhost:11434/v1, default model qwen2.5:14b-instruct) at temperature 0
with a fixed seed. Any local server exposing the same API (LM Studio,
llama.cpp server, vLLM) works via `base_url`. The pipeline never depends on
this layer: narratives are generated on demand from the IR files an
`--explain` run produced (see Explainability/narrate.py).

The anti-hallucination contract lives in SYSTEM_PROMPT: the model may only
restate the numbered fact sentences, must copy numbers and names verbatim,
must convey every [REQUIRED] fact, and must respect the [CAVEAT] lines
without restating them — the card renders those verbatim from the IR in a
section of their own. The verifier then measures how well the output honoured
that contract (hallucination + omission rates).
