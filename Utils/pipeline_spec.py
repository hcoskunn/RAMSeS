# it the other way, by ignoring the argument and scoring what they last fitted,
# so the adapter refits per call.
#
# The consequence is the same either way: a row's score would depend on where
# `eval_batch_size` happened to cut — the same window scored 1.003744 and
# 0.966958 under COF in two batches. `Utils/model_selection_utils` therefore
# hands these families the WHOLE series in one call, making the score a

# both the routing and the determinism, since the two models excluded for
# irreproducibility would otherwise look identical to these.
#
# Estimator limits, not pipeline ones: COF raises IndexError below its
# `n_neighbors` (20) rows, so Thompson — whose windows are `n_timesteps * 0.8 /
