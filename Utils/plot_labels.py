"""Detector names in figures: when to SHORTEN them, and how to say so.

Detector names are long everywhere by default — the pool name is the upstream's
own (`OmniAnomaly_1`, not `OA_1`), and that is what the run page, the
explanation cards, the comprehensive report and every figure carry. Nothing has
to be expanded on the way out.

Two figures are the exception, and only two. Both draw one label per detector
against a crowded axis, where a sixteen-character name either collides with its
neighbour or pushes the legend over the plot:

    * the ranking-score trace       (Thompson Sampling: Ranking)
    * both estimated-expected-reward traces
                                    (Thompson Sampling: Selection — and up to
                                     107 legend entries)

Those call `abbreviate_detector` on the label and `draw_abbreviation_key` under
the figure, which says what the short form stands for. Everywhere else the name
is simply used.

The key is drawn only when something in `names` actually shortens, so a pool of
LOF/HBOS/MCD gets no empty box.
