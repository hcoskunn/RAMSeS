"""Exclusive-win surrogate trees, shared by the point-injection robustness stages.

Two stages ask the same question of their own injected points: *the winner got
these right and this rival did not — what were those points like?* Off-by-threshold
injects local-statistics-scaled noise around the decision boundary; the GAN test
injects generated points near the discriminator's threshold. They differ only in
the features that describe a point, so everything downstream of the feature matrix
is the same code and lives here:

  * the join from per-point records to a per-model correctness matrix,
  * one DecisionTreeClassifier per competitor over the exclusive-win target,
  * the held-out fidelity estimate that accompanies the in-sample fit,
  * the two figures (per-competitor tree, mean importance).

Nothing in this module names a feature. The caller builds `X` and
`feature_names`; this module never inspects either beyond their shape, which is
what lets one implementation serve both stages and keeps their prose readable as
siblings rather than as two drifting copies.
