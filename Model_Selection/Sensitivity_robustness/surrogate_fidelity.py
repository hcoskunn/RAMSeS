"""Held-out fidelity estimation for post-hoc surrogate models.

In-sample fidelity (fitting a surrogate and scoring it on the same rows) is
optimistic for a high-capacity, low-bias model class like a shallow decision
tree: a tree can fit small idiosyncrasies in the observed sample that would
not reproduce on a fresh draw, so a high in-sample accuracy/R^2 does not by
itself show the surrogate has captured a generalizable pattern rather than
memorized the specific points it saw. Molnar (2022, *Interpretable Machine
Learning*, ch. on surrogate models) makes this point directly: fidelity is a
claim about how well the surrogate approximates the target model's behavior
in general, and that claim needs a held-out (or cross-validated) estimate to
be meaningful, not just a fit-quality number computed on the training rows.

These helpers wrap the classifier/regressor surrogates used throughout the
robustness explainability layer (Monte Carlo Method B, off-by-threshold /
SBA per-competitor trees) with a cross-validated fidelity estimate. The
in-sample fit is still produced and reported (it is what actually generates
the exported tree / rule text used for the human-readable explanation), but
the *fidelity number* used to judge whether the explanation is accurate
should be this held-out estimate, reported alongside it.

Both helpers degrade gracefully on the small samples typical of this layer
(a handful of noise levels x repeats, or a modest number of injected
points): they shrink the fold count to what the data can support and fall
back to leave-one-out for very small samples, rather than raising.
