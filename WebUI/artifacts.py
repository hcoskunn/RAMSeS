Read-only reader over the explainability artifacts.

Assembles the page payload from the per-stage `nl_*.txt` and `ir_*.json` files
rather than parsing `nl_global_iter*.txt`. The global text is *derived* from the
same per-stage strings by `Explainability.llm.compose_global_narrative`, so
parsing it back would be a lossy round-trip through a format whose section
separators are `"=" * len(title)` — any wording change there would silently
break the reader with no test failure. Assembling instead also yields the
structured data the text cannot carry (decision, stage agreement, per-stage
outputs, caveats, confidence), which is what makes the page readable rather than
a 2,000-word wall. The global `.txt` stays available as a verbatim download.
