"""
The summarisation seam.

Each stage card shows a summary by default with a disclosure to the full
narrative. Two kinds of summary exist, chosen per stage by `_STAGE_SUMMARY`:

  * **drop** — the narrative minus the sentences carrying a given class of
    fact, so the default view answers the stage's question and the detail moves
    behind the click. Nothing is paraphrased: every sentence shown is a
    sentence the model already wrote and the verifier already scored.
  * **table** — a deterministic table built from the IR, for stages whose
    answer is a ranking rather than a story. Built from the IR's own fields,
    never by parsing the rendered `*_explainability_*.txt` reports: those are a
    display format, and re-parsing one would be a lossy round-trip that no test
    would catch when the layout changed.

Stages absent from `_STAGE_SUMMARY` keep the whole narrative.

The contract that keeps this swappable:

* `artifacts.build_payload` is the **only** caller.
* The API always returns both `summary` and `full`, plus `summary_is_full`. The
  frontend keys its disclosure off that flag and renders the same DOM either
  way.
* `summarize` receives the narrative and the IR, never the INFO glossary — the
  glossary is fixed boilerplate, identical across runs.
* A summariser that fails must never break the page: `summarize` catches its
  own errors and falls back to the full text.
